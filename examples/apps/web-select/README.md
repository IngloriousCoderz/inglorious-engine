# web-select

A demo app showcasing the `select` component from `@inglorious/web`.

This example demonstrates three common use cases for a select/dropdown component:

- A simple, searchable single-select box.
- A multi-select box allowing for multiple selections.
- A single-select box that fetches its options from a remote source asynchronously.

Quick start:

```bash
# from repository root
cd examples/apps/web-select
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
