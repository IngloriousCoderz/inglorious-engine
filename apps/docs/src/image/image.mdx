# Image Rendering

The Inglorious Engine provides capabilities for rendering images, sprites, and tilemaps. This is essential for creating visually rich games.

## Images

The most basic form of image rendering is displaying a static image. This can be used for backgrounds, UI elements, or any non-animated visual asset. In Inglorious Engine, this is achieved by creating an entity with an `image` component and a `renderImage` behavior.

Here's a simple configuration for rendering an image:

<Source dark code={image} />

The `image` component specifies the source of the image and its properties like scale.

Below is a live example of a static image.

<Canvas of={Image.Image} />

## Tilemaps

Tilemaps are a common technique used to create game levels or large images by stitching together smaller images called tiles. The engine provides a `renderTilemap` behavior for this purpose.

An entity with a tilemap would look like this:

<Canvas of={Image.Tilemap} />

<Source dark code={tilemap} />

## Sprites

Sprites are 2D images or animations that are integrated into a larger scene. In the Inglorious Engine, a sprite is an entity with a `sprite` component and a `renderSprite` behavior.


<Canvas of={Image.Sprite} />

Animations are driven by the `spriteAnimationSystem`, which must be included in your game's `systems` array. This system allows for declarative control over animations: simply set the `entity.sprite.state` property to the name of the desired animation (e.g., "sleepy", "walk_left"), and the system will handle advancing the frames.

The `spriteAnimationSystem` is a good example of a **System** in Inglorious Engine. You can learn more about **[Systems and how they compare to entity behaviors](/docs/engine-systems--docs)**.

The `sprite` component contains information about the image source, its dimensions, and the animation frames. In the example above, the `start` event handler sets the sprite's state to "sleepy", which the `spriteAnimationSystem` uses to play the corresponding animation.

<Source dark code={sprite} />
