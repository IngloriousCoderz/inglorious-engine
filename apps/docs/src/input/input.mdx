# Input

It's pretty easy to add input controls to your game. Let's have a look.

## Mouse

If you need mouse support, it's as easy as using the `mouse()` behavior. It automatically detects movement and clicks on any entity in the scene.

You can get a reference to any entity in the scene by invoking the `api.getEntity(id)` method. The `api` object is a property of the context parameter, which is always the third parameter of an event handler.

## Keyboard and Gamepad

The recommended way to handle input from keyboards and gamepads is by using the unified `controls` behaviors.

The `controls()` and `createControls()` functions allow you to define input mappings that work for both keyboards and gamepads simultaneously, abstracting away the device-specific details. This makes your game's control logic cleaner and more flexible.

If you plug in a gamepad, there's a high chance that the engine will recognize it and you will be able to control your character with the D-pad or the left axis, using the same mapping.
