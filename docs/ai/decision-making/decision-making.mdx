# Decision Making

This section covers techniques for implementing decision-making logic in non-player characters (NPCs). These methods allow entities to react to their environment and make choices, leading to more complex and believable behaviors.

## States

Adding a states to our character is very easy, in fact every game so far was secretely using states already!

We just need to wrap our event handlers into a `states` object, set an initial `state` on our entity, and transition from one state to another inside our event handlers.

Try moving the cursor near the character to make it hunt you, and then moving it away to see the character wander around aimlessly.

This code may seem a lot, but it's just a merge of the *Arrive* and *Wander* [Kinematic AI Movement](/docs/engine-ai-movement-kinematic--docs) examples so feel free to take a look at them before approaching this one.

## Decision Trees

Decision trees are another sweet feature built-in inside of Inglorious Engine. The following example doesn't really need one, but why not?

This game also showcases sprites!
