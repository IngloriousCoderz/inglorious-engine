# Statistics

Basic statistics functions.

## Average

Alias of `mean`.

## Mean

Returns the mathematical mean of a list of numbers.

<code>mean(1, 3, 2) == {mean(1, 3, 2)}</code>&nbsp;

## Median

Returns the median value from a list of numbers.

When the list has odd length, the median is whatever value sits in between:

<code>median(1, 3, 2) == {median(1, 3, 2)}</code>&nbsp;

When the list has an even length, the median is the average of its two values in between (in this case, 2 and 3):

<code>median(1, 3, 2, 4) == {median(1, 3, 2, 4)}</code>&nbsp;

## Mode

Returns the most frequent item in a list of values.

<code>mode("rarely", "sometimes", "sometimes", "always") == {toString(mode("rarely", "sometimes", "sometimes", "always"))}</code>&nbsp;
