# Position

This module provides utility functions for physics-based position calculations.

## `calculateLandingPosition(entity, target, collisionGroup)`

Calculates the correct vertical position (`y`) for an `entity` to land on top of a `target` object, typically a platform. This function is essential for ensuring characters in a platformer game land correctly on surfaces rather than sinking into them or floating above.

The calculation is shape-aware and will correctly position both rectangular and circular entities.

### Parameters

-   **`entity`** `(Object)`: The entity that is landing. The function inspects its `collisions` property to determine its shape (`rectangle` or `circle`) and relevant dimensions (like `radius`). It checks for the specified `collisionGroup` first, then falls back to the `hitbox` group.
-   **`target`** `(Object)`: The object being landed on (e.g., a platform). The function uses its `position` and `size` from within its `collisions` property under the specified `collisionGroup`.
-   **`collisionGroup`** `(String)`: The collision group name to use for looking up collision properties on both the `entity` and `target`. Defaults to `"platform"`.

### Returns

-   `(Number)`: The calculated `y` position for the entity to be perfectly on top of the target.

### Example

<Source
  language="js"
  code={`
import { calculateLandingPosition } from "@inglorious/utils/physics/position.js"

const player = {
  radius: 10,
  collisions: {
    hitbox: { shape: 'circle', radius: 10 },
  },
}

const platform = {
  position: [200, 150, 0],
  size: [100, 20],
  collisions: {
    platform: { size: [100, 20] },
  },
}

// The player is falling and a collision with the platform is detected.
// We now need to calculate where to place the player.
const landingY = calculateLandingPosition(player, platform, 'platform')

// landingY will be 180 (platform.y + platform.height + player.radius)
// So the player's new position would be [player.x, 180, player.z]
console.log(landingY) // 180
