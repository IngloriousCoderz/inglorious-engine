# Collision Detection

Inglorious Engine provides a flexible collision detection system. You can define `collisions` properties on your entities with different shapes like circles and rectangles.

## Circle to Circle

Here is an example of two entities with circular hitboxes that detect collisions with each other.

  <Story of={CollisionStories.Circles} />

## Platformer Collisions

For platformer games, you can define platforms and characters that interact with them. The `jumpable` behavior, for instance, relies on collision detection to know when an entity is on the ground.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CollisionStories.Platform} />
</Canvas>

## Tilemap Collisions

You can also define complex collision shapes using a `hitmask` for tilemaps. This is useful for creating levels with intricate layouts.

The example below demonstrates a player colliding with a tilemap. It also uses the `spriteAnimationSystem` to animate the player character. This is a great example of how you can combine different features of the engine. You can learn more about **Systems here**.
