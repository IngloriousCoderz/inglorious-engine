# Collision Detection

Examples on how to use the built-in collision detection functions.

## Circles

Two shapes with a circular hitbox bounce against each other when colliding.

<Source dark code={circles} />

<Canvas of={Collision.Circles} />

## Platform

A character is able to jump on top of a platform and keep its `y` position.

<Source dark code={platform} />

<Canvas of={Collision.Platform} />

## Tilemap

Collision with a tilemap is very low-cost: we just need to check which tiles surrounding the sprite do collide with it.

*Hint*: Press 'c' on your keyboard to see collision debug gizmos!
