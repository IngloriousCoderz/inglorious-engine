# Image Rendering

The Inglorious Engine provides capabilities for rendering images, sprites, and tilemaps. This is essential for creating visually rich games.

## Images

The most basic form of image rendering is displaying a static image. This can be used for backgrounds, UI elements, or any non-animated visual asset. In Inglorious Engine, this is achieved by creating an entity with an `image` component and a `renderImage` behavior.

Here's a simple configuration for rendering an image:

<Source dark code={image} />

The `image` component specifies the source of the image and its properties like scale.

Below is a live example of a static image.

<Canvas of={Image.Image} />

## Sprites

Sprites are 2D images or animations that are integrated into a larger scene. In Inglorious Engine, a sprite is an entity with a `sprite` component and a `renderSprite` behavior.

Here's an example of an entity configuration for a sprite:

<Source dark code={sprite} />

The `sprite` component contains information about the image source, its dimensions, and animation frames. The `Sprite` helper provides utilities for managing sprite animations, like `Sprite.move4` for 4-directional movement.

Below is a live example of an animated sprite.

<Canvas of={Image.Sprite} />

## Tilemaps

Tilemaps are a common technique used to create game levels or large images by stitching together smaller images called tiles. The engine provides a `renderTilemap` behavior for this purpose.

An entity with a tilemap would look like this:

<Source dark code={tilemap} />

<Canvas of={Image.Tilemap} />
