The official scaffolding tool to quickly create a new web app with the [@inglorious/web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inglorious/web) framework or a static site with [@inglorious/ssx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inglorious/ssx).

This package allows you to generate a new project from a set of pre-configured templates, so you can start developing your web app right away.

## Usage

To create a new app, run one of the following commands in your terminal. You will be prompted to choose a project name and select a template.

```bash
# with npm
npm create @inglorious/app@latest

# with yarn
yarn create @inglorious/app

# with pnpm
pnpm create @inglorious/app
```

The CLI will guide you through the setup process, asking for a project name and which template you'd like to use.

## Templates

The following templates are available to get you started:

- **minimal**: A minimal starter template that requires no bundling: just HTML, CSS, and JS.
- **js**: A starter template for a plain JavaScript project, bundled with Vite.
- **ts**: A starter template for a plain TypeScript project, bundled with Vite.
- **ssx-js**: A starter template for a Static Site Xecution (SSX) project using JavaScript.
- **ssx-ts**: A starter template for a Static Site Xecution (SSX) project using TypeScript.

## What it does

The tool will create a new directory with your chosen project name and copy the template files into it. It will also automatically update the `package.json` with your project's name.

After the project is created, you can navigate into the directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
# 1. Change into your new project directory
cd my-awesome-app

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Start the development server
pnpm dev
```
