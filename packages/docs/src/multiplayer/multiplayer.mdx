# Multiplayer

The Inglorious Engine makes it incredibly easy to set up a real-time multiplayer game. The `@inglorious/server` package provides a simple, server-authoritative WebSocket server that handles all communication and state synchronization for you.

To start the example server, navigate to the `packages/server` directory of the `inglorious-engine` monorepo and run the following command:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## Controls

Once the game is running, you can control your player using a standard keyboard layout.

Player 1 uses the WASD keys to move.

Player 2 uses the IJKL keys to move.
