# Dynamic Player Controls

This section showcases different types of dynamic player controls. Dynamic
controls directly affect the entity's acceleration and velocity, resulting in
physics-based movement with inertia.

## Modern Controls

Standard video game controls where the character moves up, down, left, or right
based on input (WASD or arrow keys).

## Tank Controls

Movement is relative to the character's orientation. "Up" moves forward, while
"left" and "right" rotate the character.

## Shooter Controls

Common in top-down shooters. Movement is controlled by keys (WASD/arrows), while
orientation follows the mouse, allowing independent aiming and moving.

## Jump

Builds on modern controls by adding a jump action, usually triggered by the
space bar.

## Double Jump

Extends the jump mechanic to allow a second jump in mid-air, a staple in
platformer games.
