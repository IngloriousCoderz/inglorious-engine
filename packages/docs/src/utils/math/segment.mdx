# Segment

Utility functions for line segments.

## Coefficients

Retrieves values of *a*, *b*, and *c* from a segment, so it looks like a line in the form *ax + by + c = 0*.

<code>coefficients(\{ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [2, 0, 1] \}) == {vToString(coefficients({ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [2, 0, 1] }))}</code>&nbsp;

## Distance from point

Computes the distance between a segment and a point.

<code>distanceFromPoint(\{ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [3, 0, 4] \}, [5, 0, 0]) == {distanceFromPoint({ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [3, 0, 4] }, [5, 0, 0])}</code>&nbsp;

If the point rests on the segment, it will return zero.

<code>distanceFromPoint(\{ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [2, 0, 2] \}, [1, 0, 1]) == {distanceFromPoint({ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [2, 0, 2] }, [1, 0, 1]).toFixed(0)}</code>&nbsp;

If the point does not project on the segment, returns the distance between the point and the closest end of the segment.

<code>distanceFromPoint(\{ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [3, 0, 4] \}, [-2, 0, 0]) == {distanceFromPoint({ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [3, 0, 4] }, [-2, 0, 0])}</code>&nbsp;

<code>distanceFromPoint(\{ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [3, 0, 4] \}, [5, 0, 4]) == {distanceFromPoint({ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [3, 0, 4] }, [5, 0, 4])}</code>&nbsp;

## Intersects circle

Checks if a segment overlaps with a circle.

<code>intersectsCircle(\{ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [2, 0, 2] \}, \{ position: [1, 0, 1], radius: 1 \}) == {toString(intersectsCircle({ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [2, 0, 2] }, { position: [1, 0, 1], radius: 1 }))}</code>&nbsp;

A segment tangent to the circle is considered to be intersecting with it.

<code>intersectsCircle(\{ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [0, 0, 2] \}, \{ position: [1, 0, 1], radius: 1 \}) == {toString(intersectsCircle({ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [0, 0, 2] }, { position: [1, 0, 1], radius: 1 }))}</code>&nbsp;

A segment resting inside of the circle is considered to be intersecting with it.

<code>intersectsCircle(\{ from: [0.5, 0, 0.5], to: [1.5, 0, 1.5] \}, \{ position: [1, 0, 1], radius: 1 \}) == {toString(intersectsCircle({ from: [0.5, 0, 0.5], to: [1.5, 0, 1.5] }, { position: [1, 0, 1], radius: 1 }))}</code>&nbsp;

A segment that does not cross a circle does not intersect with it.

<code>intersectsCircle(\{ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [-2, 0, -2] \}, \{ position: [1, 0, 1], radius: 1 \}) == {toString(intersectsCircle({ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [-2, 0, 2] }, { position: [1, 0, 1], radius: 1 }))}</code>&nbsp;

A segment is different from a line: even if its continuation would cross the circle, the segment itself does not.

<code>intersectsCircle(\{ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [-1, 0, -2] \}, \{ position: [1, 0, 1], radius: 1 \}) == {toString(intersectsCircle({ from: [0, 0, 0], to: [-1, 0, 2] }, { position: [1, 0, 1], radius: 1 }))}</code>&nbsp;
