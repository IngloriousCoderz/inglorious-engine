 * it is returned unchanged. This is particularly useful for ensuring that the results of standard array operations
 * (like `.map()` or `.filter()`) which return a new array are correctly re-tagged as vectors.

 * @returns {T extends number[] ? Vector : T} The value as a vector, or the original value if no conversion was needed.
