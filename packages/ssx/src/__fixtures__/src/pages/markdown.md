# A Markdown Page

This is an example page made with Markdown. It works pretty well!

Code can be highlighted:

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello World!")
}
```

LaTeX formulas are also supported:

$$
\displaystyle\sum_{k=3}^5 k^2=3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 =50
$$

And even charts!

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
