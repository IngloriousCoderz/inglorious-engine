The official scaffolding tool to quickly create a new game with the [Inglorious Engine](https://github.com/IngloriousCoderz/inglorious-engine).

This package allows you to generate a new project from a set of pre-configured templates, so you can start developing your game right away.

## Usage

To create a new game, run one of the following commands in your terminal. You will be prompted to choose a project name and select a template.

```bash
# with npm
npm create @inglorious/game@latest

# with yarn
yarn create @inglorious/game

# with pnpm
pnpm create @inglorious/game
```

The CLI will guide you through the setup process, asking for a project name and which template you'd like to use.

## Templates

The following templates are available to get you started:

- **js**: A minimal starter for a plain JavaScript project.
- **ts**: A minimal starter for a plain TypeScript project.
- **ijs** (IngloriousScript): A starter template for a JavaScript project using IngloriousScript via Babel.
- **its** (IngloriousScript w/ TypeScript): A starter template for a TypeScript project that uses IngloriousScript.

## What it does

The tool will create a new directory with your chosen project name and copy the template files into it. It will also automatically update the `package.json` with your project's name.

After the project is created, you can navigate into the directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
# 1. Change into your new project directory
cd my-awesome-game

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Start the development server
pnpm dev
```
