# Inglorious Engine

A JavaScript game engine written with global state, immutability, and pure functions in mind. Have func(tional programming) with it!

## Docs

Documentation is a Storybook: once you clone the repo, just install packages with `pnpm install` and then start Storybook with `pnpm storybook`.

## Tests

Unit tests are available through `pnpm test`. They are another pretty good source of documentation, especially for utility functions.
