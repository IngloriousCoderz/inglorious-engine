# Games

Ezpz is a headless game engine that takes a configuration file in plain JavaScript and creates a scene. The UI can be implemented in any technology: canvas, HTML, ...here we are using React components.

But the best documentation is through examples, so here's a few games!

## Empty

The most minimal configuration you can pass is an empty object. This will render an 800x600 scene with a light grey background.

Here's the code for this beauty:

<Source code={`export default {}`} />

<Canvas of={Games.Empty} />

## Bounds

We can customize the game's bounds by passing an array of four numbers: these will hold the upper and lower bounds in pixels.

<Source code={`export default {
  bounds: [0, 0, 600, 800]
}`} />

<Canvas of={Games.Bounds} />

## Types And Instances

Let's add something to the scene. The game configuration requires that we specify a static part, which is stuff that will never change, and a dynamic part, which is basically the current game state.

The static part includes the definition of each `type` of actors we want to show on the screen. For convenience we provide a type called `character` that shows as a circle with a triangle, to easily show its position and orientation.

In the dynamic part we add an instance of this type. In this basic scenario the `character` instance needs to specify only its type and position. Something like this:

<Source code={`export default {
  types: {
    character: {}
  },

  state: {
    instances: {
      instance1: { type: 'character', position: [400, 0, 300] }
    }
  }
}`} />

<Canvas of={Games.Instances} />

## Event Handlers

To animate stuff we write event handlers for events that are triggered by our instances or by the game itself. The `game:update` event, for example, is triggered at every cycle of the game loop.

An event handler accepts the following arguments:

- The `instance` itself that is handling the event, so we can change its properties to our needs;
- The triggered `event`, which contains a `payload` that holds whatever we need to accomplish our task;
- An `options` object that contains the following:
  - The `elapsed` time, which can help slow down certain movement algorithms based on the current FPS;
  - The game's current `config` object (here you can find the scene's `bounds`, for example);
  - All `instances` present in the scene; note that they are read-only, so look but don't touch!

The `fps` type shows FPS debug info on the top left of the scene; its value is updated based on the `elapsed` time at every `game:update` event.

<Source code={`export default {
  types: {
    fps: {
      'game:update'(instance, event, { elapsed, config, instances }) {
        instance.value = elapsed
      }
    }
  },

  state: {
    instances: {
      instance1: { type: 'fps', value: 0 }
    }
  }
}`} />

<Canvas of={Games.EventHandlers} />

## Default Handlers

Coding is beautiful, but reusing code without reinventing the wheel is even better!

The event handler for this character is using a predefined `bounce()` function which makes it look like one of those old DVD logo screensavers.

This time the `character` needs to specify not only its position but also its initial velocity, so the `bounce()` function can update both. 

<Source code={`import { bounce } from '@ezpz/utils/character'

export default {
  types: {
    fps: {
      'game:update'(instance, event, { elapsed }) {
        instance.value = elapsed
      }
    },

    character: {
      'game:update'(instance, event, { config }) {
        bounce(instance, config.bounds)
      }
    }
  },

  state: {
    instances: {
      instance1: { type: 'fps', value: 0 },

      instance2: {
        type: 'character', position: [0, 0, 0], velocity: [10, 0, 5] }
    }
  }
}`} />

<Canvas of={Games.Bounce} />

So far so good? Let's move on to some complex stuff then! See how we can trigger some more events, such as [input](/?path=/docs/games-input--docs) events, then take a look at some [recipes](/?path=/docs/games-recipes--docs) that give life to our game!
