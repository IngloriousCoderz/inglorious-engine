# Inglorious Engine

Welcome to the official Inglorious Engine's docz! This project, and its related documentation, is a _HUUUGE_ work in progress, but feel free to stick around and, if you like what you see, maybe you will feel like cheering or contributing!

Inglorious Engine is a headless game engine that takes a configuration file in plain JavaScript and creates a scene. The UI can be implemented in any technology: canvas, HTML, ...here we are using React components.

But the best documentation is through examples, so here's a few games!

## Empty

The most minimal configuration you can create is an empty object. This will render an 800x600 scene with a light grey background.

Here's the code for this beauty:

<Source dark code={empty} />

<Canvas of={Engine.Empty} />

## Bounds

We can customize the game's bounds by passing an array of four numbers: these will hold the upper and lower bounds in pixels.

<Source dark code={bounds} />

<Canvas of={Engine.Bounds} />

## Types And Instances

Let's add something to the scene. The game configuration requires that we specify a static part, which is stuff that will never change, and a dynamic part, which is basically the current game state.

The static part includes the definition of each `type` of actors we want to show on the screen. For convenience we provide a type called `character` that shows as a circle with a triangle, to easily show its position and orientation.

In the dynamic part we add an instance of this type. In this basic scenario the `character` instance needs to specify only its type and position. Something like this:

<Source dark code={instances} />

<Canvas of={Engine.Instances} />

## Event Handlers

To animate stuff we write event handlers for events that are triggered by our instances or by the game itself. The `game:update` event, for example, is triggered at every cycle of the game loop.

An event handler accepts the following arguments:

- The `instance` itself that is handling the event, so we can change its properties to our needs;
- The triggered `event`, which contains a `payload` that holds whatever we need to accomplish our task;
- An `options` object that contains the following:
  - The elapsed time `dt`, which can help slow down certain movement algorithms based on the current FPS;
  - The game's current `config` object (here you can find the scene's `bounds`, for example);
  - All `instances` present in the scene; note that they are read-only, so look but don't touch!

The character shown here updates its velocity and position at every frame, going back and forth like it's patroling the scene!

The `fps` type shows FPS debug info on the top left of the scene; its value is updated based on the `dt` time at every `game:update` event.

## Code Reuse

Coding is beautiful, but reusing code without reinventing the wheel is even better!

All the code necessary to draw the character is now encapsulated in a `enableCharacter()` function. To be precise, this is a decorator. Note how the `character` type can now accept an array of decorators: you can combine as many decorators as you wish to give the character new features!

The event handler for this character is using a predefined `bounce()` function which makes it look like one of those old DVD logo screensavers. There are many predefined functions out there at your disposal, just look into the docz to find the ones that suit you best.

## Fixed Framerate

What if you want to provide a more retro feel to your game? You can use a fixed framerate and make your animations more jerky.

<Source dark code={framerate} />

So far so good? Let's move on to some complex stuff then! See how we can trigger some more events, such as [input](/docs/engine-input--docs) events, then take a look at some [recipes](/docs/engine-recipes--docs) that give life to our game!
