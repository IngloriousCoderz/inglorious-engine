# Kinematic Movement

The algorithms described here make an NPC instance move by changing its velocity. The movement is a little snappy but it does the trick for simple games.

Every algorithm returns some parameters, such as velocity, position, and orientation, which can be merged to the instance.

Most examples here make use of user [input](/?path=/docs/games-input--docs), so check those out if you haven't already.

## Seek

The seek algorithm makes the instance chase a target. Speed is constant and it makes the character flick around the target once reached.
