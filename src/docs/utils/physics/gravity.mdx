# Gravity

We can consider gravity as a constant acceleration downards. [This video](https://youtu.be/hG9SzQxaCm8) shows how to calculate this acceleration based on the curve that we want our character to draw when jumping. Also, it rightfully warns to keep jump parameters separate from our world coordinates. That's why we need a specific acceleration, velocity, and position to model our jumps.

- `maxJump` is the maximum height that we want to achieve;
- `maxLeap` is the maximum distance we want to cover with a jump;
- `maxSpeed` is the maximum horizontal speed when running;
- `vy` is the current jump velocity;
- `py` is the current jump height.

<code>applyGravity(\{ maxJump: 10, maxLeap: 10, maxSpeed: 10, vy: 10, py: 10 \}, \{ dt: 1 \}) == {toString(applyGravity({ maxJump: 10, maxLeap: 10, maxSpeed: 10, vy: 10, py: 10 }, { dt: 1 }))}</code>&nbsp;

Not specifying `maxJump` and `maxSpeed` will result in no gravity being applied:

<code>applyGravity(\{ maxLeap: 10, maxSpeed: 10, vy: 10, py: 10 \}, \{ dt: 1 \}) == {toString(applyGravity({ maxLeap: 10, maxSpeed: 10, vy: 10, py: 10 }, { dt: 1 }))}</code>&nbsp;

<code>applyGravity(\{ maxJump: 10, maxSpeed: 10, vy: 10, py: 10 \}, \{ dt: 1 \}) == {toString(applyGravity({ maxJump: 10, maxLeap: 10, vy: 10, py: 10 }, { dt: 1 }))}</code>&nbsp;

While not specifying `maxLeap` will result in an error, since we have to divide by this quantity:

<code>applyGravity(\{ maxJump: 10, maxSpeed: 10, vy: 10, py: 10 \}, \{ dt: 1 \}) == Error(['maxLeap'])</code>&nbsp;
