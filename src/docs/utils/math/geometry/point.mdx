# Point

Intersection functions for a point.

## Overlaps Point

Checks if a point is in the same place as another.

<code>overlapsPoint([1.5, 0, 1.5], [1.5, 0, 1.5]) == {toString(overlapsPoint([1.5, 0, 1.5], [1.5, 0, 1.5]))}</code>&nbsp;

<code>overlapsPoint([1.5, 0, 1.5], [2, 0, 1]) == {toString(overlapsPoint([1.5, 0, 1.5], [2, 0, 1]))}</code>&nbsp;

## Overlaps Circle

Checks if a point is inside of a circle.

<code>overlapsCircle([1.5, 0, 1.5], \{ position: [1, 0, 1], radius: 1 \}) == {toString(overlapsCircle([1.5, 0, 1.5], { position: [1, 0, 1], radius: 1 }))}</code>&nbsp;

<code>overlapsCircle([2, 0, 2], \{ position: [1, 0, 1], radius: 1 \}) == {toString(overlapsCircle([2, 0, 2], { position: [1, 0, 1], radius: 1 }))}</code>&nbsp;

## Overlaps Rectangle

Checks if a point is inside of a rectangle.

<code>overlapsRectangle([1.5, 0, 1.5], \{ position: [1, 0, 1], size: [2, 2] \}) == {toString(overlapsRectangle([1.5, 0, 1.5], { position: [1, 0, 1], size: [2, 2] }))}</code>&nbsp;

<code>overlapsRectangle([2.5, 0, 2.5], \{ position: [1, 0, 1], size: [2, 2] \}) == {toString(overlapsRectangle([2.5, 0, 2.5], { position: [1, 0, 1], size: [2, 2] }))}</code>&nbsp;
